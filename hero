 hair and covered her beautiful eyes with glasses.And entered with a pretty smile.may be this is
 called LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.On that day I decided to propose her.And tried to talk with her.I made
 her my friend with in two days.I tried to know her intrests and hobbies and wishes too to know 
 about herself finely.As days go on we became best friends.As soonly her bithday came and I
 presented a Glass teddy bear key chain on which the word I LOVE YOU was written with small letters.
 Finally i decided to propose her and called her,she lifted the call and i said to take the key
 chain in to her hands which i was gifted. And said to read th sentence which was written on it 
 secretly.And she saw it and said I LOVE YOU then I immediately said I LOVE YOU TOO.This was my
 first proposal.The later story will be continued in the next part of this
